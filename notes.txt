CURRENT BRANCH: ArrayToList

UP TO: Checking validation for filtering still (run program to see)
Idea from: Ben J., 2nd year DSA Tutor

CASE 1:
    - Creates two lists: ALL and FILTER; the first is a complete list that 
    remains complete for usage in CASE 2.
    - ALL receives the file input, and copies this to FILTER.
    - FILTER is then optionally filtered, ordered and printed to screen/file.
    - From there ALL is available for use elsewhere.

FORMAT.JAVA line 348 - if validation for choice
- Not using Validation.java because it's simple, and because it would have
meant over re-work of my validateChoice function
- I understand that usually I have the invalid if block first, but this 
inexplicably caused issues - so I'll do it this way 
    UNLESS IT WORKS WITH STRING EQUALS - TESTING
