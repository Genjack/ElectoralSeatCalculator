Date started: Thursday, 11th October 2018.

Note on initial notes: Sorting may come down to using a stable sort.

Aim: To find which divisions need to be visited for 'maximum impact'.
- So visiting swing districts basically - where the race is tight.
- So find places where 2016 results show close contest with a larger margin of
error perhaps.

Polling data should be aggregated into divisions. Will be distances between 
these divisions (in the two csv files provided). 
- Means weight for graph edges.
