1) User.java - Originally created by me in OOPD last semester to be a generic 
   java input class; has served me well on numerous occasions.

MENU.JAVA - prepareToList( Candidate [], DSALinkedList<Candidate> )
DESCRIPTION:
    This function will basically present a bunch of new options to the user in
    the form of a menu, hence its inclusion within the Menu class. The user will
    be greeted with a series of options to FILTER and/or ORDER BY certain
    attributes contained within the Candidate class. The array will then be 
    manipulated to put these selected entries into a linked list, which will
    then be displayed to the user. This should end the case, and loop back to
    the main menu. May have to add/adjust some booleans to avoid this step after
    the file has already been read (i.e. no need to read file again).

NOTE ON validateParty()
    I chose to put these parties all in an array, because I figured it would
    be faster to parse an array of a few dozen once, rather than have someone
    enter LNO instead of LNP and have the program search through hundreds of 
    entries only to find that the spelling was wrong all along.
